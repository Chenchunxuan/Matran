$ 
$ Description:
$ - Bulk data file containing the bulk data for the wing spar beam properties. 
	The beam properties for each beam element are assumed to be piecewise-constant (pc).
$
$ Notes
$ - The original version of this file can be found at: 
$   \\rdsfcifs.acrc.bris.ac.uk\AWI_HARW_Test_Data\Documents\Design\NastranModel\FinalWing\noPod
$ - The piecewise-constant beam properties were generated from the full FE model by Guillaume 
$   Francois using a reduction method in Patran.
